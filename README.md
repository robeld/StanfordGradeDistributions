### Stanford Grade Distributions
This was made because Carta is very slow at searching individual classes and I wanted an easy way to compare grade distributions between classes in a quick manner. This repo only contains the code for the program. 
### How to Run the Program
# Run the .exe file (easiest, slowest)
The one file .exe for the script can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzgOklOC90u9NlQzeFZsYjdvSWM/view. Simply download it, double click, and wait for the .exe to run.
# Download all the dependencies and run the application inside the zipped folder
The zipped folder containing all the dependencies can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzgOklOC90u9dDZRaHRmNWRtOXc/view. Unzip the folder and click on the application inside to run the program (ignore all the other files). The zipped version may be faster than the one file .exe, especially for large numbers of classes.
# Run the Python code
If you have Python, just run the code.
